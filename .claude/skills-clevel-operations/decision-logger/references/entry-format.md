# Decision Entry Format & Conflict Detection

## Decision Entry Format

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] — [AGENDA ITEM TITLE]

**Decision:** [One clear statement of what was decided.]
**Owner:** [One person or role — accountable for execution.]
**Deadline:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Review:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Rationale:** [Why this over alternatives. 1-2 sentences.]

**User Override:** [If founder changed agent recommendation — what and why. Blank if not applicable.]

**Rejected:**
- [Proposal] — [reason] [DO_NOT_RESURFACE]

**Action Items:**
- [ ] [Action] — Owner: [name] — Due: [YYYY-MM-DD] — Review: [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Supersedes:** [DATE of previous decision on same topic, if any]
**Superseded by:** [Filled in retroactively if overridden later]
**Raw transcript:** memory/board-meetings/[DATE]-raw.md
```

## Conflict Detection

Before logging, Chief of Staff checks for:
1. **DO_NOT_RESURFACE violations** — new decision matches a rejected proposal
2. **Topic contradictions** — two active decisions on same topic with different conclusions
3. **Owner conflicts** — same action assigned to different people in different decisions

When a conflict is found:
```
⚠️ DECISION CONFLICT
New: [text]
Conflicts with: [DATE] — [existing text]

Options: (1) Supersede old  (2) Merge  (3) Defer to founder
```

**DO_NOT_RESURFACE enforcement:**
```
🚫 BLOCKED: "[Proposal]" was rejected on [DATE]. Reason: [reason].
To reopen: founder must explicitly say "reopen [topic] from [DATE]".
```

## Marking Actions Complete

```markdown
- [x] [Action] — Owner: [name] — Completed: [DATE] — Result: [one sentence]
```

Never delete completed items. The history is the record.
